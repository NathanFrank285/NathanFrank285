### Hi there <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="30px">, I'm Nathan Frank!

My name is Nathan Frank and I am from southern california, but currently live in San Francisco. I went to the University of Southern California where I studied business with a focus in finance.

Today I am a developer following my passion of turning ideas into reality. My favorite tools for coding are Python, Javascript, React / Redux, Ruby, and Flask. There is nothing better than working with a like-minded team to create a flawless product.
